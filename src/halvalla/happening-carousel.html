We have collected four mature stalks each week.  They have been drying slowly over the time with no loss in weight, until this Monday’s inspection and harvest.

            One bamboo stick placed on the roof of the building showed signs of burrowing last week.  This week I noticed the bamboo was considerbly lighter, and found several new burrows on the three week old stalks.  The four week old stalks were curing inside the room, hence they still had more water retention and less evidence of insect activity.

        The oldest sticks inside the room actually showed some signs of new dust.  A mitzvah.  The ancient ones have spawned their new generation.

        Dr. Tory has several specimen sites around the campus to help narrow down the most favorable conditions for infestation, with an eye to water-preserved bamboo: how well does it stop the attack?
